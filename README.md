# Quasimorph External Log

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

A utility for developers.

Adds the "Unity External Log Window" to the game.
The project can be found here:  https://github.com/NBKRedSpy/Unity-External-Log-Window

Note that the window output will not contain any info prior to the game loading the mod.  However, that information can be found in Unity's player.log file.
